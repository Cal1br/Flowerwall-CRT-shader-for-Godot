# Flowerwall-CRT-shader-for-Godot
My take on a CRT Shader for Godot, inspired by CRT-Royale.

# How to install
Simply drag and drop the `addons` folder into your Godot project. You should now see the plugin under `Project Settings` -> `Plugins`.

# How to use
Enable the plugin in your project settings. You can access the configurations by pressing F1.
